### Hi there, I'm Andrey ðŸ‘‹

I do QA things. I really enjoy learning languages and work on test automation, discover new approaches on improving things. You can check out test automation frameworks that I built with detailed descriptions on my repo page https://github.com/andrey-yudin-7?tab=repositories
